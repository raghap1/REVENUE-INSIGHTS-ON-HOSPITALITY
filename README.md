# REVENUE-INSIGHTS-ON-HOSPITALITY
Created an interactive dashboard with Power Bi to help client optimize sales strategies and improve decision making with provided Revenue Insights.

## Project background & Overview
## Background:

  AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel chain in India, has been losing market share and revenue due to poor decision-making and competitive pressure. To fix this, the management decided to adopt data-driven strategies but lacked an in-house analytics team. They hired a third-party service to analyze historical data and deliver actionable insights.
## Overview
As a data analyst engaged by the revenue management team, the goal of this project is to transform raw historical data into meaningful business intelligence. The scope includes:
- Developing core business metrics as specified in the stakeholder-approved metric list.
- Designing and building a performance dashboard based on a mock-up provided, aligning with key stakeholders' visual and functional expectations.
- Uncovering additional insights beyond the predefined metrics to support strategic decision-making, revenue optimization, and market competitiveness.

This project plays a critical role in enabling AtliQ Grands to make informed, data-backed decisions to enhance operational efficiency, improve revenue management, and regain its competitive edge in the premium hospitality sector.
